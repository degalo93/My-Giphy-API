# My-Giphy-API

For this project I aimed to make a function gif searching program that would look for gif's mainly video game related. 

In this project the main focus was learining how to use API's. I used the giphy API to make this page.

Im my javascript I included an array that would have some preset things to look up
I also included an add button to add to the list of inital topics
